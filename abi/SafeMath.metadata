This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"user-rating/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[":/=/",":ds-auth/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-auth/src/",":ds-auth=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-auth/src/index.sol",":ds-math/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-token/lib/ds-math/src/",":ds-math=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-token/lib/ds-math/src/index.sol",":ds-note/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-pause/lib/ds-note/src/",":ds-note=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-pause/lib/ds-note/src/index.sol",":ds-pause/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-pause/src/",":ds-pause=lib/dss-deploy/lib/ds-pause/src/index.sol",":ds-test/=lib/ds-test/src/",":ds-test=lib/ds-test/src/index.sol",":ds-thing/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-value/lib/ds-thing/src/",":ds-thing=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-value/lib/ds-thing/src/index.sol",":ds-token/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-token/src/",":ds-token=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-token/src/index.sol",":ds-value/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-value/src/",":ds-value=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/lib/ds-value/src/index.sol",":dss-deploy/=lib/dss-deploy/src/",":dss-deploy=lib/dss-deploy/src/index.sol",":dss/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/src/",":dss=lib/dss-deploy/lib/dss/src/index.sol",":esm/=lib/dss-deploy/lib/esm/src/",":esm=lib/dss-deploy/lib/esm/src/index.sol"]},"sources":{"user-rating/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x640b6dee7a4b830bdfd52b5031a07fc2b12209f5b2e29e5d364a7d37f69d8076","urls":["bzz-raw://31113152e1ddb78fe7a4197f247591ca894e93f916867beb708d8e747b6cc74f","dweb:/ipfs/QmbZaJyXdpsYGykVhHH9qpVGQg9DGCxE2QufbCUy3daTgq"]}},"version":1}
